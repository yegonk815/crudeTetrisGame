# crudeTetrisGame
A very rough Tetris game I created using ChatGPT's Code Copilot GPT.

The purpose of this exercise was to use some prompt engineering techniques I've recently learned to create a workable Tetris game.
The initial prompt was: 

You are a video game designer for Ubisoft games. You have been given the task of creating a simple Tetris game for PC in the style that has the styling of any Ubisoft game, but with the following specs and features:
1.	The game opens in a 600 px width, 350 px height window
2.	Background color is grey
3.	Code written in Python language
4.	Has a Welcome to Tetris screen that allows you to click “Play” or click “Settings”
  	    a.	After player clicks “Settings” screen pops up allowing the player to change the rate of each falling block from 1 (slowest) to 5 (fastest)
        b.	After player makes this choice, player can click the “Back” button at the bottom of the screen where their selection is saved.
        c.	After player clicks “Play” the game begins.
6.	Scoring is the same as the original Tetris game

Ask me any additional questions (one at a time) if needed to complete this request.

I had subsequent prompts and then physically changed some of the code in order to give me something that was workable.
This still has some functionality issues (and also could be made prettier), but for the purposes of my exercise, this is what I came up with.
